# Jaaw! - Just Anoher Animated Wallpaper

## What is this for

This is a python 3 script, based on PyQt5, compatible with Windows 8-10 (by the moment)

It will allow you to customize your desktop wallpaper, using an image, a folder (Carousel-mode) or a VIDEO!

Furthermore, you won't need any Admin privileges to install it (it's fully portable) or use it.

## How to use it

Run it, and right-click on the Jaaw! tray icon to access options menu:

* Image / Single image - Select an image as static Wallpaper
* Image / Folder - Select a folder containing all images you want to show in carousel mode
* Video - Select a video to show as wallpaper... looks awesome!
* Help
* Quit

#### IMPORTANT

The application and tray icons are... well, horrible. I have no graphic design capabilities at all. Download or design your own! Don't forget to place them on "resources" folder and rename them accordingly

### PENDING

* Add period selection for image carousel on settings
* Refactor bkgutils (win32) functions
