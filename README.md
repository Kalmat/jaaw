# Jaaw! - Just Anoher Animated Wallpaper

## What is this for

This is a python 3 script, based on PyQt5, compatible with Windows 8-10 (by the moment)

It will allow you to customize your desktop wallpaper, using an image, a folder (Carousel-mode) or a VIDEO!

Furthermore, you won't need any Admin privileges to install it (it's fully portable) or use it.

## How to use it

Run it, and right-click on the Jaaw! tray icon to access options menu:

* Image / Single image - Select an image as static Wallpaper
* Image / Folder - Select a folder containing all images you want to show in carousel mode
* Video / Local - Select a local video file to show as wallpaper... looks awesome!
* Video / YouTube - YES! Enter a YT video reference and play it in the background!!! (e.g. OhBo1A8atuA, BHACKCNDMW8, lM02vNMRRB0, bx-0YlFprqc, msnYBMdaB08, _hHwz1UWJmI)
* Web / Daily random Chromecast images (links from: https://bing.gifposter.com)
* Web / Daily Bing images (links from: https://github.com/dconnolly/chromecast-backgrounds/blob/master/backgrounds.json)
* Web / Enter any URL of your choice and use
* Help
* Quit

#### IMPORTANT

This module stores no images from any web site or source of any kind. It just uses public links to show images as your wallpaper

The application and tray icons are... well, horrible. I have no graphic design capabilities at all. Download or design your own! Don't forget to place them on "resources" folder and rename them accordingly
