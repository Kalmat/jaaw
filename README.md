# Jaaw! - Just Anoher Animated Wallpaper

## What is this for

This is a python 3 script, based on PyQt5, compatible with Windows 8-10 (by the moment)

It will allow you to customize your desktop wallpaper, using an image, a folder (Carousel-mode) or a VIDEO!

Furthermore, you won't need any Admin privileges to install it (it's fully portable) or use it.

## How to use it

Run it, and right-click on the Jaaw! tray icon to config your preferred settings
